' <summary>
' This class uses a symmetric key algorithm (Rijndael/AES) to encrypt and
' decrypt data. As long as it is initialized with the same constructor
' parameters, the class will use the same key. Before performing encryption,
' the class can prepend random bytes to plain text and generate different
' encrypted values from the same plain text, encryption key, initialization
' vector, and other parameters. This class is thread-safe.
' </summary>
' <remarks>
' Be careful when performing encryption and decryption. There is a bug
' ("feature"?) in .NET Framework, which causes corruption of encryptor/
' decryptor if a cryptographic exception occurs during encryption/
' decryption operation. To correct the problem, re-initialize the class
' instance when a cryptographic exception occurs.
